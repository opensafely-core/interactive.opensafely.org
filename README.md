# OpenSAFELY Interactive

OpenSAFELY Interactive is an accessible and interactive, automated analysis pipeline.

Its aim is to:

1) support NHS Service analysts, who make decisions based on dashboards, which are currently normally produced in point-and-click environments

2) make it easier and quicker for researchers to do exploratory analysis, so they understand the value of OpenSAFELY for their research

## Archived data

This service has been discontinued, but an archive of the production database contents has been retained for future reference in the bennett-backup DigitalOcean space.
