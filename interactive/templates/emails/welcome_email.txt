Once you've setup your account, you'll be able to login to the website, {{ domain }}, and request an analysis by clicking on "Get started".

In the early development phase, you will be able to analyse the rate of recorded coding activity in primary care across a specified time period, using all SNOMED CT codelists that have been used in OpenSAFELY projects for covid-related purposes.

Once your analysis has been run, we will send you an email with instructions on how to view the results.
